For handwritten mathematical notes, get assist? Currently forked from xournal, running tiny-dnn and a mnist digit recognizer in a difficult to discern magic box that will write out which number to the console. Neither impressive nor interesting yet.

To build, you need cmake and a bunch of dependencies, but once you have figured out that dark magic:
* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake ..
* make
* cd ..
* build/xournal



Forked from Xournal 0.4.8 http://xournal.sourceforge.net/
